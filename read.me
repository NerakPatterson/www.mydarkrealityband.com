I recreated my band website to make the website more polished. 
The website is more responsive and SEO friendly than it was on wix.com.
It features merch and links to the webstore. This will be updated to reflect actual purchases. 
The about is more to the point about the band.
The home page features a music player and an faq section.
The video and music page will be updated as the band performs and releases more music.
The contact form connects to the bands email using freeform.
The footer is cleaner linking to the bands main social media and music pages.
